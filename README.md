# 2i-Challenge-Sumil

The function find_largest_sum takes an array of strings as input and returns an integer. <br>
It uses nested loops to iterate through each character of each string in the array.<br>
If the character is a digit, it adds the integer value of the digit to the current sum.<br>
If there are multiple strings with the same largest sum, the function will return the sum found in the first occurrence.<br>
