#The function find_largest_sum takes an array of strings as input and returns an integer__
#It uses nested loops to iterate through each character of each string in the array.__
#If the character is a digit, it adds the integer value of the digit to the current sum.__
#If there are multiple strings with the same largest sum, the function will return the sum found in the first occurrence.__
