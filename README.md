# 2i-Challenge-Sumil

#The function find_largest_sum takes an array of strings as input and returns an integer
#It uses nested loops to iterate through each character of each string in the array.
#If the character is a digit, it adds the integer value of the digit to the current sum.
#If there are multiple strings with the same largest sum, the function will return the sum found in the first occurrence.
